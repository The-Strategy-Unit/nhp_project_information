We store Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data on Databricks. 
The NHS Data Dictionary is available to [view online](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hospital-episode-statistics-data-dictionary).

The code for the processing and extraction of data for this project is available openly in the [nhp_data repository](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data).
