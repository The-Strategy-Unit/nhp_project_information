Data is sourced from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Outpatient Appoitments (OP) dataset.
We extract aggregrated appointment level data for a given year.

## Pre-processing

### Age

In the model we join to other datasets by age. However, these other datasets cap out at different ages, with the
lowest-common denominator being 90 years.
Anyone aged over 90 is assigned to have an age of 90.

The age field in HES encode's the age of neonatal patients with values over 7000.
In these cases we set the age to 0.

### Provider code

Over time, some NHS organisations merge.
This information is provided in the [organisation successors][ods_succ] from the Organisation Data Service (ODS).

[ods_succ]: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/export-data-files/csv-downloads/miscellaneous

We use the successors lists to map historical data to the current organisation.
For example, if provider `A` merged with provider `B` in 2023, when we extract data from 2019 we would remap any data
for `A` to `B`.

## Filtering

We select records where the `SEX` is either 1 or 2 (Male/Female). This causes some records to be lost where the sex is
not known, or is neither male or female. However, the population growth part of the model depends upon this field having
one of the two stated values above.

We select rows where the `ATENTYPE` is one of the following

- ` 1`: Attended first appointment
- ` 2`: Attended subsequent appointment
- ` 3`: Attended but first/subsequent/tele unknown
- `21`: Attended first tele consultation (from 2008-09)
- `22`: Attended subsequent tele consultation (from 2008-09)

## Derived fields

### `is_surgical_specialty`

- when the `tretspef` field is either `"180"`, `"190"`, `"191"`, or `"192"`, then `0`
- when the `tretspef` field starts with a `"1"`, then `1`
- otherwise, `0`

### `is_adult`

- when the `apptage` field is greater than or equal to 7000, then `0`
- when the `apptage` field is greater than or equal to 18, then `1`
- otherwise, `0`

### `is_gp_ref`

- when the `refsourc` field is `"03"` and the `firstatt` field is either `"1"` or `"3"`, then `1`
- otherwise `0`

### `is_cons_cons_ref`

- when the `refsourc` field is `"05"` and the `firstatt` field is either `"1"` or `"3"` and the `sushrg` field is either `"WF01B"` or `"WF02B"`, then `1`
- otherwise `0`

### `is_first`

- when the `atentype` field is either `"1"` or `"21"`, then `1`
- when the `atentype` field is either `"2"` or `"22"`, then `0`
- otherwise, `NULL`

### `is_tele_appointment`

- when the `atentype` field is either `"1"` or `"2"`, then `0`
- when the `atentype` field is either `"21"` or `"22"`, then `1`
- otherwise, `NULL

### `has_procedures`

- when the `sushrg` starts with `"U"` or `"WF"`, then `0`
- otherwise, `1`

### `type`

- if the `is_adult` is `1`:
  - if the `is_surgical_specialty_field` is `1`, then `"adult_surgical"`
  - otherwise, `"adult_non-surgical"`
- otherwise:
  - if the `is_surgical_specialty_field` is `1`, then `"child_surgical"`
  - otherwise, `"child_non-surgical"`

### `hsagrp`

take the `type` field, and append:

- if the `has_procedures` field is `1`, then `"procedure"`
- if the `is_first` field is `1`, then `"first"`
- otherwise, `"follow-up"`

### `group`

- if the `has_procedures` field is `1`, then `"procedure"`
- if the `is_first` field is `1`, then `"first"`
- otherwise, `"follow-up"`

### `tretspef`

If the `tretspef` is in the list of RTT specialties, then leave as is, otherwise, set it to:

- if it starts with a `"1"`, but isn't `"180"`, `"190"`, or `"192"`, then `"Other (Surgical)"`
- if it is `"560"`, then `"Other"`
- if it is `"180"`, `"190"`, `"192"`, `"831"`, `"833"`, or `"834"`, then `"Other (Medical)"`
- if it starts with a `"2"`, "`3"`, "`4"`, "`5"`, "`6"`, then "Other (Medical)"
- otherwise, `"Other"`

### `is_wla`

This is set to `true` - it simplifies the logic within the model to have the same fields for the waiting list adjustment in both Inpatients and Outpatients.

## Maternity activity

Note that maternity activity is excluded from Outpatients mitigators. This activity is identified with treatment specialty codes `424`, `501`, `505`, and `560`.

## Aggregation

We aggregate by counting how many rows of data appear within the extraction period for each provider.
The rows that we group by are the fields that are required within the model, and for whatever cut of results are required in the outputs.

These are:

- `age`
- `sex`
- `tretspef`
- `sitetret`
- `is_main_icb`
- `is_surgical_specialty`
- `is_adult`
- `is_gp_ref`
- `is_cons_cons_ref`
- `is_first`
- `has_procedures`
- `type`
- `hsagrp`
- `group`
- `is_wla`

We create two columns:

- `attendances` are the count of face to face attendances within that group.
- `tele-attendances` are the count of tele-appointments within that group.
