## Purpose

The NHP Demand model includes a component which adjusts hospital activity based on anticipated changes in the population size and age/sex structure. The current version of the model contains a full set of the subnational population projection variants published by ONS. 

## Population projections

Projections are used to understand how the size and age/sex structure of the population served by a hospital will change over time. The ONS publish national population projections for the constituent countries of the UK and separately sub-national population projections for England, which show change at the level of local authority district.

Sub-national population projections include counts by single year of age to age 89, whereas the national projections include counts to age 104. To model activity by single year of age to age 99 we distribute the 90-plus population within each local authority district based on England data.

The ONS population projections datasets are widely regarded as being the best available at a national level and come with quality assurance from ONS.

## Hospital catchments {#hosp-catchments}

A single hospital site will have a good understanding of the communities of patients it serves - based on spatial proximity or patterns of clinical presentation - but this 'catchment' population may not map neatly to administrative boundaries. Therefore, we construct a weighted population catchment for each hospital trust from local authority level projections.

For each local authority, we calculate the percentage of inpatient admissions—broken down by age and sex—that are attributable to each provider for residents of that area.

::: {.callout-note}
$$
\sum_{i} \sum_{j} P_{ij} \cdot s_{ij}
$$

where:

* $P_{ij} = Population in age group $i$ and sex $j$ for a local authority
* $s_{ij} = Share of all activity for that local authority in age group $i$ and sex $j$
:::

We then estimate each provider’s catchment population by multiplying the population of each local authority (by age and sex) by the corresponding percentage of admissions for that provider, and summing these values across all local authorities.

For example, suppose Local Authority A has 100 ten-year-old males and Provider X accounts for 50% of their admissions. Local Authority B has 200 ten-year-old males, with Provider X accounting for 10% of their admissions. The estimated catchment for ten-year-old males for Provider X would be:

$$
100 \times 50\% + 200 \times 10\% = 50 + 20 = 70
$$

The full methodology for generating the population catchment for demographic growth can be [seen here](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data/blob/main/reference/provider_catchments.py).

## Variant projections {#variant-projs}

Alongside their main ('migration category' as of v4.0.0) projection, ONS also publish a range of variant projections. These variant projections are based on alternative assumptions of future fertility, mortality, and migration. We construct catchments based on variant projections using the same method as for the main projection (see [Hospital catchments](#hosp-catchments)).

Sub-national population projections include five variant projections based on different assumptions about migration levels and trends. 

The [complete set of projections](list_of_projections.qmd) available to the model is available in this documentation and includes 5 variants alongside the main ('migration category') projection.

## Birth Adjustment

If maternity activity is modeled in the same way as other types of activity then future demand will depend on changes in the number of women of child-bearing age (assuming maternity activity is recorded against the mother, as opposed to the child). For example, maternity activity for 35-year-old women will increase or decrease inline with changes in the number of 35-year-old females in the general population. A better approach is for maternity activity to depend on changes in the number of births by age of the mother e.g. maternity activity for 35-year-old women increases or decreases inline with the number of births expected to 35-year-old mothers. We use data on projections of births by age of mother to implement this approach.

## Summary

The NHP Demand model includes a component which adjusts hospital activity based on anticipated changes in the population size and age/sex structure.  The current version of the model contains a full set of the subnational population projection variants published by ONS.  ONS publish some additional population variants at a national level. We have imputed sub-national versions of these variants and made these available within the NHP model.

## User selection of demographic projections

In most cases we expect users to select and use ONS's main ('migration category') population projection.  Users are however, free to select, for example the high migration or low fertility projections if they wish, but these variants should be used with caution and only after familiarisation with the assumptions that underpin these non-standard projections.  In addition, users can select several of the variants and indicate how often they wish these to be used in the model's Monte-Carlo replications.

## Custom demographic projections

Users may request the use of a custom population projection for specific schemes, by contacting their Model Relationship Manager. Any proposed alternative population projection will require the evidenced support of the ICB and region.

## How demographic growth is applied in the model: a worked example

The ONS population projections that have been adapted for each provider output data in something like the following format. Note that there are more rows of data than are shown here, with data for each age from 0-90, for each sex. There is also in the full projection more columns of data, for every year from the baseline year to the last year available from the ONS subnational population projections. We have simplified it considerably for this example.

| Gender | Age | 2019 | 2029 | 2039 |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| M   | 73  | 240  | 255  | 262  |
| F   | 23  | 190  | 193  | 196  |
| F   | 93  | 360  | 400  | 432  |
: Example of demographic growth file for a provider trust

The model works by only modelling the horizon year. Full details of the modelling methodology are available on the [modelling uncertainty page](../modelling_uncertainty.qmd). 

| ID  | Age | Gender |  PoD | Length of stay |
| :-- | :-- | :----- |  :-- | :------------- |
| 1   | 73  | m      |  NEL | 7              |
| 2   | 23  | f      |  EL  | 1              |
| 3   | 93  | f      |  NEL | 8              |
: Example baseline data

In the table above, we have three example rows of inpatient data from the baseline year for the selected provider. In practice there would be thousands of rows. For each row, we look up the age and gender in the demographic growth file. We then divide the ONS projected population in the horizon year for that age/gender by the ONS calculation of the actual population in the baseline year for that age/gender, to get a growth factor.

For example, for row ID 1, we would take 262/240 = 1.09 as the demographic growth factor for a scenario using a baseline year of 2019, and a horizon year of 2039. For row ID 2, we would take 196/190 = 1.03; for row ID 3, we would take 432/360 = 1.2. Note that we do not use any data from the intermediate years between the horizon year and the baseline year. The demographic growth factor for each row is then multiplied with the other factors in the Poisson sampling step, with the product of all of these factors then used as $\lambda$ (lambda).
